# Stratigos AI Platform - Serverless

A serverless implementation of the Stratigos AI Platform using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3.

## Overview

The Stratigos AI Platform is a comprehensive solution for portfolio management, optimization, and risk analysis. This serverless implementation provides a scalable, cost-effective, and maintainable architecture that can handle varying workloads while minimizing operational overhead.

## Architecture

This project uses a pure serverless approach with the following AWS services:

- **AWS Lambda**: For executing code in response to events
- **Amazon API Gateway**: For creating, publishing, and managing APIs
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: For storing and retrieving data
- **Amazon S3**: For storing static assets and large datasets
- **AWS CloudFormation/SAM**: For infrastructure as code
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging

For a detailed architecture overview, see [ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md](./ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md).

## Features

- **Portfolio Management**: Create, read, update, and delete portfolios
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Optimize portfolios using various strategies
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulate portfolio performance
- **Market Data**: Access market data for analysis
